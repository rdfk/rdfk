# 👋 Hi, I'm Rick

I'm a Python dev-in-training using AI and voice dictation to overcome physical limitations.  
I build tools that solve real problems and support others through tech.

## 🔧 Interests
- Python scripting & automation
- Tech support & troubleshooting
- AI-assisted workflows (voice, accessibility, productivity)

## 📦 Projects
- 🔐 **Password Generator** – Creates secure passwords using customized word mutation logic  
- 🧹 **File Organizer** – Automatically sorts files into folders based on type  
- 💡 More coming soon as I learn and build!

## 💬 Let's Connect
I'm still in the early stages of this journey, but always open to project ideas, learning opportunities, and potential collaborations.
